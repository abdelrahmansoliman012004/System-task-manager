## 🚀 Project Overview

**System Task Manager** is a Linux-focused tool for real-time system resource monitoring and task automation. It combines:

- Bash and Python scripting
- GUI support via Zenity
- CLI fallback for headless environments
- Docker containerization for portability

It enables system administrators and users to inspect and control CPU, memory, disk, network, GPU, and processes interactively.

## 📦 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Bash
- Python 3
- Zenity (for GUI)

### Docker Installation

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t system-task-manager .

# Run the container (requires privileged mode for full hardware access)
docker run -it --privileged system-task-manager
```

---

## ▶️ Usage Instructions

Once inside the Docker container:

### Launch GUI/Console Interface

```bash
./sys_mon.sh
```

You’ll be prompted to choose **GUI** or **Console** mode.

### Console-Only Mode

```bash
./project_os.sh
```

### Generate Report via Python

```bash
python3 code_python.py
```

> Reports and logs are saved to your desktop path (you may change them in the scripts).

---

## 💡 Example Workflow

1. Start `sys_mon.sh` and login
2. Monitor system in GUI or Console mode
3. View SMART status or terminate processes
4. Generate full system report and graphs with Python

---

## 🔧 Customization

- Change hardcoded paths like `/home/abdelrahman2274/Desktop/` to `$HOME` or relative paths
- Update credentials in `sys_mon.sh` for login security
- Add more Zenity dialogs or CLI options as needed
